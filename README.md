## 👋 Introduction
Welcome to my **Python Fundamentals** repository! 

This project documents my structured journey from basic syntax to advanced engineering concepts in Python. As a **Computer Engineering student**, my goal was not just to learn the syntax, but to understand the **underlying logic, algorithms, and best practices** (Clean Code, DRY, OOP) required for professional software development.

This repository serves as the **foundation** for my upcoming work in **Data Science and Machine Learning**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into modular folders, following a step-by-step learning curriculum:

├── 01_Basics/              # Variables, Data Types, Type Casting
├── 02_Control_Flow/        # If/Else, Loops (For/While), Logic Gates
├── 03_Data_Structures/     # Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples (Hash Maps)
├── 04_Functions/           # Methods, Lambda, Map/Filter, Args/Kwargs
├── 05_OOP_Concepts/        # Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
├── 06_File_Handling/       # Reading/Writing TXT files, Context Managers
└── 07_Modules_Libraries/   # Custom Modules, Imports, Built-in Libraries

## 🏆 Key Projects & Highlights
Here are some of the mini-projects and key implementations included in this repo:

### 1. Bank Management System (OOP) 🏦

Location: 05_OOP_Concepts/project_bank_system.py

Concepts: Class Inheritance, Encapsulation (Private variables), Method Overriding.

Description: A simulation of a banking system with different account types (Savings vs. Checking) and secure balance management.

### 2. Number Guessing Game 🎮

Location: 02_Control_Flow/project_guess_number.py

Concepts: Random library, While Loops, Conditional Logic, Input Validation.

Description: An interactive game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number with hints.

### 3. Data Cleaning Utilities 🧹

Location: 04_Functions/03_lambda_map_filter.py

Concepts: Lambda functions, Map & Filter operations.

Description: Functional programming examples used for filtering data and converting units (Essential for Data Science).
